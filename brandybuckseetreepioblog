I have no time.
I take some time nonetheless to dream of something bigger than me.
I need religion, ideology, personal development tool, and philosophical school.
I know: religion and politics should be separate, otherwise it's the beginning of totalitarism.
But this kind of school of life I'm looking for don't want to be the only one.
This kind of religion likes diversity for religions, ideologies, personal development tools, and philosophical schools.
This kind of religion likes debates and alliances with others "story tellers".
Actualy, I could probably find what I'm looking for in a movement that still exists.
So this blog is an attempt to create something, and in the same time to discover things that still exist, and to share.

I would have a lot to say about how I imagine a religion for me.
But my first urgency is to define an exercice of meditation in order to ge enough strongness to do what I must do these days.
The first commandement could be to plan your day with ambition but with realism and kindness too.
You could plan to do nothing anticipate from five to ten, but you should decide it.
Because some time you need freedom, sometimes you need a simple way where you are not oblige to think about everything.
So I'm going to do that. Then, I think every day Mind fullness meditation or Stocian meditation could help.
I'll write here what I would have choose, but it's very subjective: for now, it's just a beginning of a personal search.
